# Bubble Sort
A program which prints an unsorted array of random integers and sorts the array from least to greatest. The program accomplishes this by comparing the elements of the array to its adjacent values, and swaps the larger of the two towards the front of the array. The program will display each pass until the array is fully sorted.

# Selection Sort
This program also prints an array of unsorted integers and will select the first value and compare it to all other values in the array until a smaller value is found. When the end of the array is reached, the smallest value is then placed in the first index of the array and the program will move on to the second position and repeat the process untill the array is fully sorted from least to greatest.

# Linear Search
Linear search is a method that will step through an unsorted array of integers comparing each position to a known variable until a match is found. If no match is found, the method will return that the array does not contain the value in question. 

# Binaray Search
Different from the Linear search method, Binary will sort the array first and then select the middle value and compare it to the variable in question. If the value is greater than the variable, the method will move to the larger half of the array, or, if the value is less than the variable, the method will move to the smaller half. The method will repeat this process until a match is found, or return that the value does not exist in the array.
